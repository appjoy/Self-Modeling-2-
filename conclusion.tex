\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conc}

In this paper, we performed an in-depth study of the feasibility of self-constructive per-component power model
derivation (SPMD) on modern smartphones. Using two representative phones,
we identified the equation diversity as the primary challenge of SPMD
and explored diverse time-scales in trying to create equations that exhibit high diversity.  
Our experiments and analysis have shown that it is extremely difficult to create equations with sufficient diversity for the regression solver to generate meaningful per-component power model parameters. 
Our verification work debunked a myth about the applicability of SPMD at the per-component level.
